# Eye Project
## This project uses JavaScript to dynamically move a hmtl object with the movement of the mouse. CSS is also leveraged to create the aesthics of an actual eye on the page
# How to Run
## To run this code, you'll have clone this git and once you have that done, you'll be able to run the hmtl document that will automatically move the eyeball to follow the mouse on the screen
# Roadmap of Future Improvements
## I'd like to add some javascript to randomly change the color of the eyeball on a mouse click
# License
## Please refer to the MIT licenses document located in the repo
